Action **yutailang0119--action-ktlint/v4.0.1** was hardened automatically. 2 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### unpinned-uses (severity: high)

The workflow file uses `actions/checkout@v4.2.2` (twice), which is a version tag reference rather than a pinned 40-character commit SHA. This means the action could be silently updated or compromised without the workflow noticing. Both occurrences should be replaced with the full SHA digest of the intended commit (e.g., `actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2`).

Locations:

- `.github/workflows/test.yml:13`
- `.github/workflows/test.yml:20`

### missing-permissions (severity: medium)

The workflow file `.github/workflows/test.yml` has no top-level `permissions:` key, and neither the `build` job nor the `test` job defines its own `permissions:` block. Without explicit permissions, the workflow inherits the repository's default token permissions, which may be overly broad. A minimal `permissions:` block (e.g., `contents: read`) should be added at the top level or per job.

Locations:

- `.github/workflows/test.yml:1`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** unpinned-uses, missing-permissions

**Notes:**

Fixed hardened/action/.github/workflows/test.yml: (1) Pinned both `actions/checkout@v4.2.2` references to the full commit SHA `11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` with the tag preserved as a comment. (2) Added a top-level `permissions: contents: read` block to enforce least-privilege token access.
